The system will use a webcam to capture the user’s face, analyze it through a trained deep learning model, and identify emotions like happy, sad, angry, surprised, or neutral. Based on the detected emotion, the system will generate a suitable text response that matches the user’s mood, making human–computer interaction more natural and engaging.
